         <p>When it all started for me. Simply, because I found this Youtube <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRanDRgYxu8" target="_blank"> video</a>. Thank you very much for the motivation and for starting this dream for me, Mr. Chris Sean. Suddenly, in a related video, I saw something called <b>Web Development Practical Guide</b>. Needless to say that from this moment on this was my guiding star through all my journey. Whenever I got doubts to where to go next, I went back to this video, in search for guidance. Thank you for everything Mr. Brad Traversy.

                During this initial phase, I've started with the basic of the basics. I've started to learn HTML and CSS, with only Youtube tutorials.<br> The one I've followed particularly was this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqvFIuVlyP8&index=1&list=PL41lfR-6DnOruqMacTfff1zrEcqtmm7Fv" target="_blank"> playlist </a>, taught by Quentin Watt Tutorials .<br>
       <br>
       

<p>I've also started to watch some random videos about HTML and CSS, whenever I've found them in Youtube.<br>
       

                Two of the youtube channels that I remember to have checked during this phase were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners/videos" target="_blank"> DevTips </a> and (of course)
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb/videos" target="_blank"> Traversy Media </a>. <br>However, I just saw the most basic videos of these channels 
                
(the ones that were focused only in HTML and CSS, for absolute begginers) such as: </p> <br>
 <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ONvIgOWdM&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy" target="_blank">CSS Playlist</a>
             </li>
     
     <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kK-cA99SA0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1WMjDx4snI" target="_blank">Centering with CSS</a>
             </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kejG8G0dr5U and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6zAP4YnZA">CSS Positions</a>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

          <ul>   
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&index=1&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU" target="_blank">HTML Crash Course</a>
             </li>
     
     <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI&index=2&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU" target="_blank">CSS Crash Course</a>
             </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&index=3&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU">Build An HTML5 Website With A Responsive Layout</a>
             </li>
            </ul>
            

<br>
<p>
Those gave some very basic notions of HTML and CSS.

In order to consolidate my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I started to test If I could reproduce exactly some of the website layouts that I knew.
<a href="https://www.ryanair.com/">Ryanair's </a> website was the one I've reproduced the most. I would definitely recommend this tactic, to start practising HTML and CSS. 
With the aid of Stack Overflow, you will learn a lot and feel like you're evolving on your knowledge. I was now eager to jump to JavaScript.

            <img src="images/september.png" height="35">
            <br>
       
            <p>As I've mentioned previously I was eager to jump to JavaScript (:P).<br><br>

Duering this phase and after searching on Reddit, I've found that one of the most recommended resources for a complete begginner was a course available on Udemy. 

The practical aspect of the course, the considerable length and the fact that the syllabus seemed truly complete, made me advance to this option.<br>

This is the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/">course</a>  and was taught superbly by Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann.
                </p>
        <br>
            <p>Parallel to the JavaScript course, I've started to learn Git and Github. Definitely, I must acknowledge a huge friend of mine, who insisted (literally, every single day) that I had to learn this tool (and he was correct).
<br>
I saw a free course, that was also available on  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-e-github-para-iniciantes/">Udemy</a>. However, this one is taught in Portuguese, but I believe
                you won't have any trouble finding a similar one that you can understand. Also, I consolidated my knowledge with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc">this</a> tutorial from Mr. Brad.
                </p>
         <br>
         <p>After completion of the course taught by Mr. Jonas, (and to really deepen my practical knowledge of JavaScript), I've found the absolutely free<a href="https://javascript30.com/"> 30 day Vanilla JavaScript Challenge </a> (which was ultra recommended on my Reddit searches) and amazingly instructed by Mr. Wes Bos. I tried to do it whenever I had a little time, but due to my full time job and other obligations, it was not an easy task.</p>

            <p>On this day, I saw the following tutorials about animations.
                </p>
          <br>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhHqiGCG10E" target="_blank">Javascript effects: scrolling animations</a>
             </li>
           <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBCH0-K124" target="_blank">Animations and effects: hero banner</a>
             </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zLJ0I8Djk" target="_blank">Animations and effects: parallax</a>
             </li>
           <li><a href="  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MilW6gVPYJM" target="_blank">Scroll Effect using JavaScript</a>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
           <p>Also (after a recomendation from a friend of mine), I checked a tutorial about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc">Flexbox.</a>
                </p>

        Very tough week due to work related issues. All what I could watch, was a very short video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WH0Mvkp2Fs ">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<br>  
<br> 
<p>
Also, after being told during several weeks to just do it (thank you Mr. João Pimpão), I've finally deployed my super complex (not) personal page, that you are reading right now.
I've used the hosting service <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify </a> and for the <a href="www.miguelponte.com"> custom domain</a>, I've used <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap </a>, that costed me around 8 euros 
(for 1 year subscription).<br> <br> 

    How was the deploying process?<br> In a brief explanation, after you sign in in Netlify, you just need to upload a <i> .zip</i>  file containing a file named <i>index.html</i>. Then you go to a domain sercive
like Namecheap and create/buy the domain with the designation that you desire. After the creation of the domain in Namecheap, you go to settings and copy the information about 
    a thing called <b>nameservers</b>. 
You go back to Netlify and under the domain settings, you change the domain name for the one you created on Namecheap. After this, you can see that there is a
    section called <b>nameservers</b>. This is where you paste the <b>nameservers</b> copied from Namecheap. <i>Et voilá</i>, congratulations, you have now deployed your website.

       During this week, I continued to perform the 30 Day Vanilla JavaScript challenge.
I was still at challenge number 6 (due to my full time job which was making me really, really busy lately).

When performing this challenge (related to AJAX), I got some doubts with the JavaScript fetch function. To understand it better, I saw 
        the following tutorials about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82hnvUYY6QA">AJAX</a> and about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs">Fetch</a>, given by Mr. Brad.</p>
